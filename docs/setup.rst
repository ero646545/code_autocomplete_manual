Check the Installation
######################

Open the text editor in Blender and look at the toolbar. You should see
these two new panels:

When there is a error message *Jedi library not found* you have to use another
.zip file in the beginning. Direct download from the github page is not supported,
because the Jedi library is a submodule which isn't included in these downloads.
You can either use an official release or use git to download the repository
and its submodules (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/JacquesLucke/code_autocomplete.git`).
follow this video to install the jedi submodule: https://youtu.be/2idzkdoNZ2M
or just paste this https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/tree/7651157487511aadc118f7a8753adf709fad1708
into this C:\Users\"computer name"\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.78\scripts\addons\code_autocomplete-master\jedi

Finish the Setup
################

As last step you should click on the **Build BPY Module** button which creates a
fake python module for large parts of the normal bpy module, so that Jedi can
autocomplete types that are implemented in C instead of Python.
